***Instructions***

1. Save all available MATLAB files in a directory (e.g. on your drive **X** in the folder `mBGe`).
 
   - `SCRIPT.m`
   - `MCMC_mBGe.m`
   - `compute_CPDAG.m`
   - `compute_AUPRC.m`
   - `compute_rSHD.m`


2. Open MATLAB.

3. In the MATLAB Command Window, go to the selected directory.

For example (if your are using Windows), type:

```matlab
cd X:\mBGe
```

4. The MATLAB command lines from the script 'SCRIPT.m' can now be copied and pasted
into the Command Window and executed line-by-line.
